## About Me

Hi there! I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, co-advised by [**Gillian Hadfield**](https://gillianhadfield.org) and [**Tianmin Shu**](https://www.tshu.io). I earned my Bachelor of Science in Statistics & Data Science and Cognitive Science from the University of California, Los Angeles in June 2025. 

Throughout my undergraduate years, I conducted research at the intersection of computational cognitive modeling, probabilistic inference, and visual and analogical reasoning. I was fortunate to be advised by [**Tao Gao**](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~taogao/Taogao.html) at UCLA and Volkan Ustun at the [**USC Institute for Creative Technologies**](https://ict.usc.edu). I also worked as a research assistant at the [**UCLA Computational Vision and Learning Lab**](https://cvl.psych.ucla.edu). 


## Research Interests
I am passionate about building **safe, trustworthy, and human-aligned** AI.

My primary interest lies in **how intelligent agents can align their values and behavior in social environments**, especially when objectives are partially conflicting and rules are not explicitly defined. Human societies rely on shared norms and institutions to sustain social equilibrium. I am curious about how similar mechanisms can be modeled, inferred, and learned by artificial agents.
